Kubernetes Resources

Here are some resources I referred for CKAD preparation

	1. Linux Foundation LFD259 : Kubernetes for Developers course is an official training offered by Linux foundation. It is very useful for understanding basic K8s concepts. Fortunately, I got a good Christmas combo deal for LDF259 course and CKAD Exam .
	2. Kubernetes Up and Running - by Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns and Joe Beda: What better resource than the book by creators themselves. This is another good resource for understanding concepts in depth. 
	3. Udemy course by Mumshad Mannambeth : This is an excellent course in which you can practice commands on exam-like environment. 
	4. https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises: Must Try these exercises 2-3 times before you appear.
